# Hierarchy of `thing`s.
#
# The `ThingHierarchy` is a tree structure stored as a map of `ThingId` to `ThingHierarchy`. This structure is strictly unidirectional.
#
# This defines the nesting, but perhaps we should use it to define the relative positioning as well.
#
# Do we want users to have control? Probably some, e.g. the order of declaration affects the
# position of the `thing` in a flex box.
#
# Other question, the positioning for a software dependency tree is different to the positioning
# for deployment topology. Maybe we allow the user to specify either "rank" based layout or "flow"
# based layout.

# How to position things on the diagram.
#
# Not sure if this is the right approach yet, but ideas:
#
# * `rank`: `thing_dependencies`' edges affect how far a `thing` is from the beginning position.
# * `flex`: `thing_hierarchy` alternates between horizontal and vertical flex axes.
#
# ```yaml
# thing_layout:
#   # one of:
#   flex: "row"
#   # flex: "column"
#   # rank: "horizontal"
#   # rank: "vertical"
# ```

# Dependencies between things can be one way, or symmetric.
#
# Dependencies are static relationships between things, and should be rendered as "on" or "off"
# depending on whether a `thing` is focused / targeted, and whether the user wants to see:
#
# * Predecessors / successors linked to this thing.
# * Immediate dependencies vs transitive (maybe closest `n` neighbours).
#
# * When B depends on A, it means A must exist before B.
# * Changes to A means B is out of date.
#
# How we render dependencies (forward / backward / undirected / bidirectional arrows) can be
# defined separately from the meaning of the dependency.
#
# We want to make it easy to define dependencies between chains of things.

# Interactions between things can be cyclic, a sequence, or symmetric.
#
# IDs here must not be the same as the ones in `thing_dependencies`, because the `entity_type`s'
# styling will collide.
#
# For 1 thing in a list, A, B, C, the following edges are added:
#
# * `cyclic`: `A -> A` (one edge from the node pointing back to itself).
# * `sequence`: none.
# * `symmetric`: `A -> A -> A` (two edges, one representing a request, one representing a response).
#
# For 3 things in a list, A, B, C, the following edges are added:
#
# * `cyclic`: `A -> B -> C -> A`.
# * `sequence`: `A -> B -> C`.
# * `symmetric`: `A -> B -> C -> B -> A`.
#
# Interactions have the same data structure as dependencies, but are conceptually different:
# `thing_dependencies` is intended to represent dependencies between software libraries,
# while interactions are communication between applications.
#
# There *are* ordering dependencies between interactions, but *when* it is useful to render
# `thing_dependencies` and `thing_interactions` differ. Dependencies are static at a point in time,
# so it is useful to render the links between multiple `thing`s; interactions are present when a
